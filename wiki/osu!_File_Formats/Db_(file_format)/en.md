# .db (file format)

**.db** files are binary files used by osu! to store various information, including a cache of beatmap properties, present users, cached replay data, and user beatmap collections.

They can be usually found in the osu! installation directory:

- Windows: `%localappdata%\osu!`
- Mac OSX: `/Applications/osu!.app/Contents/Resources/drive_c/Program Files/osu!/`

Currently the only ones are osu!.db, scores.db, collection.db, and presence.db.

## Data Types

To ease the description of the format of each .db file, the following names for data types will be used. Unless otherwise specified, all numerical types are stored little-endian. Integer values, including bytes, are all unsigned. UTF-8 characters are stored in their canonical form, with the higher-order byte first.

| Name | Number of bytes | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Byte | 1 | integer |
| Short | 2 | integer |
| Int | 4 | integer |
| Long | 8 | integer |
| ULEB128 | Variable | integer; see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128) |
| Single | 4 | 32-bit IEEE floating point value |
| Double | 8 | 64-bit IEEE floating point value |
| Boolean | 1 | 0x00 for false, everything else is true |
| String | Variable | Has three parts; a single byte which will be either 0x00, indicating that the next two parts are not present, or 0x0b (decimal 11), indicating that the next two parts are present. If it is 0x0b, there will then be a ULEB128, representing the byte length of the following string, and then the string itself, encoded in UTF-8. See [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8). |

## osu!.db

**osu!.db** contains a cached version of information about all currently installed beatmaps. Deleting this file will force osu! to rebuild the cache from scratch. This may be useful since it may fix certain discrepancies, such as beatmaps that had been deleted from the Songs folder but are still showing up in-game. Unsurprisingly, due to its central role in the internal management of beatmaps and the amount of data that is cached, osu!.db is the largest of the .db files.

### Format

Some data types specific to osu!.db are defined below.

| Name | Number of bytes | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Int-Double pair | 14 | The first byte is 0x08, followed by an Int, then 0x0d, followed by a Double. These extraneous bytes are presumably flags to signify different data types in these slots, though in practice no other such flags have been seen. Currently the purpose of this data type is unknown. |
| Timing point | 17 | Consists of a Double, signifying the BPM, another Double, signifying the offset into the song, in milliseconds, and a Boolean; if false, then this timing point is inherited. See [.osu (file format)](/wiki/osu!_File_Formats/Osu_(file_format)) for more information regarding timing points. |
| DateTime | 8 | A 64-bit number of ticks representing a date and time. Ticks are the amount of 100-nanosecond intervals since midnight, January 1, 0001 UTC. See [.NET framework documentation on ticks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime.ticks?view=netframework-4.7.2) for more information. |
